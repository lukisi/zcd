On a same domain we connect:
 alpha (PID 1234)
  eth0 fe:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa
 beta (PID 567)
  eth0 fe:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb
 gamma (PID 890)
  eth0 fe:cc:cc:cc:cc:cc

beta listens to datagrams on dev eth0 and to streams on 169.254.0.1

beta broadcasts on eth0 "I am beta, my IP 169.254.0.1"
but nobody is listening

alpha listens to datagrams on dev eth0 and to streams on 169.254.0.2

alpha broadcasts on eth0 "I am alpha, my IP 169.254.0.2"
beta receives on eth0 and deduces:
  alpha has IP 169.254.0.2
  alpha has got a NIC (nic_alpha) on the same domain as my eth0

beta streams to 169.254.0.2 "I am beta, my IP 169.254.0.1"
alpha replies "OK" and deduces:
  beta has IP 169.254.0.1
  beta has got a NIC (nic_beta) on the same domain as my eth0

gamma listens to datagrams on dev eth0 and to streams on 169.254.0.3

gamma broadcasts on eth0 "I am gamma, my IP 169.254.0.3"
beta receives on eth0 and deduces:
  gamma has IP 169.254.0.3
  gamma has got a NIC (nic_gamma) on the same domain as my eth0
alpha receives on eth0 and deduces:
  gamma has IP 169.254.0.3
  gamma has got a NIC (nic_gamma) on the same domain as my eth0

alpha broadcasts on eth0 "Message: pippo. Send ACK."
beta receives on eth0, prints "pippo" and sends ack.
gamma receives on eth0, prints "pippo" and sends ack.
alpha receives acks from nic_beta and nic_gamma.
